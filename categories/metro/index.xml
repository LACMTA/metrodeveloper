      <description>Hello Developers! I haven&amp;rsquo;t introduced myself properly yet. I am the Lead Developer and Architect fro Metro.net. I work for Metro&amp;rsquo;s Dept. of Creative Services. I will save a more general introduction for another post. But first I would like to dive into this discussion the GTFS data set.
michichan makes good observations about our scheduling, especially how we define lines and routes. I am not an expert in this area, but I know that the size of our system compels us to make these kinds of articulations in the data.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, welcome to Metro&amp;rsquo;s new developer site. Metro.net/developer is our new technical resource site meant to attract a community of developers and foster innovative technology. This is the place to share data with interested groups including developers as well as academics, and transit partners. We are launching with two types of data and the start of a web service.
As this is a new effort for Metro, we hope to make more data and resources available as they are ready.</description>
