## Overview

The Google Transit Feed Specification is an open format that Google created to allow transit agencies to easily provide schedule data to Google Transit. However, Google encourages its use for other applications, and itâ€™s available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (free) license.

## Publicly available GTFS feeds
A number of transit agencies and operators have already published their schedule data in GTFS format for developers to use.
