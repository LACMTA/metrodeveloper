## Hello Developers! 

I haven't introduced myself properly yet. I am the Lead Developer and Architect fro Metro.net. I work for Metro's Dept. of Creative Services. I will save a more general introduction for another post. But first I would like to dive into this discussion the GTFS data set.

michichan makes good observations about our scheduling, especially how we define lines and routes. I am not an expert in this area, but I know that the size of our system compels us to make these kinds of articulations in the data. I'm sure that there were no arbitrary decisions made about the data, and that the care definition of line and route is born out of the constraints of this medium.

I encourage everyone to download the Schedule Viewer and load up the data set. When you start working with our schedule data the first thing you'll notice is how large it is. I understand that it takes up to an hour to load, parse and validate the whole set even on a speedy quad-core machine.

This release of the GTFS data contains another surprise. We make two system-wide changes to service each year (we call them "shake-ups"), and that time is coming soon. Study the GTFS archive to see how the good people in Service Planning represent these changes. The complexity of the system never fails to thrill me.

Note that I moved michichan's post from the main list to the place below. This move was in no way meant to diminish michichan's comment. We simply want make sure that it's clear who works for Metro and who is a member of the developer community.
