## Hello everyone, welcome to Metro's new developer site.

Metro.net/developer is our new technical resource site meant to attract a community of developers and foster innovative technology. This is the place to share data with interested groups including developers as well as academics, and transit partners. We are launching with two types of data and the start of a web service.

As this is a new effort for Metro, we hope to make more data and resources available as they are ready. The best way to keep abreast of these updates is to subscribe to this blog (look for the RSS link on this page). We also encourage interested parties to join our community (click on the sign up button in the top toolbar) and give us feedback, help us make this site better.

In addition to news about Metro data, we'll also post updates about our current rebuild/redesign effort of our main website, metro.net

Thanks for stopping by,

Lan-Chi Lam, Interactive Design Manager (Metro)
